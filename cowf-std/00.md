# COWF
### Language subset for quick things
---

Cowf is a language for Static purposes or Dynamic coding.

Cowfiles are multimedia filetype, which support for the use of code, and or dynamics in order to create programs and or optimized filetypes.

---

### Why

---

Cowf aims to solve one specific issue, complexity.

Most people go ahead implementing filetypes for one specific purpose, and usually done well, makes a fast and robust environment for data.

These formats are usually static though, as to save against lossyness, and the other dangers of dynamics and non-static environments.

Cowf, however aims to reach this dynamic possibility by being as simple and robust.

### Base Operations?
###### As of the beta state. Changes will be listed.

---

Cowf has a simplified token-based paradigm,

```fortran
! Assingment
! Syntax:  { OPER } { NAME } [: { Parameter }]

! { OPER } = Operation
! { NAME } = Name
! { Parameter } = The Parameter
! [: { Parameter }] = Optional, of the syntax `: { Parameter }`

=>    ! Assign as Any
=)    ! Define Function.

=|    ! Assign as Logical.
=]    ! Assign as Array.
=}    ! Assign as Object.
=.    ! Assign as Pointer.
=;    ! Assign as Type.
```

### Cowf-Heads? What are these?

---

An important part of using Cowf is specifying what kind of Cowf the file is.

The head is defined as a Function.
